## w3schools SQL tutorial

The instructor writing this does not like w3schools for html & javascript reference, which they are frequently the top google search result for. Mozilla's MDN documentation is better.

(don't read their sections on CREATE TABLE options, they don't cover sqlite3 specific rules for those)

This is a great cheatsheet:
