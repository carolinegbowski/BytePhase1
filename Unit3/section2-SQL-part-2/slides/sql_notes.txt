## Notes

# searching across a single join:

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM user_searches JOIN search_terms ON user_searches.term_id = search_terms.id;

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM user_searches JOIN search_terms ON user_searches.term_id = search_terms.id WHERE search_terms.word = "trousers";

# searching across two tables joined by a third table:

SELECT users.name, search_terms.word FROM users JOIN user_searches JOIN search_terms ON user_searches.user_id = users.id AND user_searches.term_id = search_terms.id;

# ^ that gives me a view of all fields from all 3 tables where the user searched for the particular term
